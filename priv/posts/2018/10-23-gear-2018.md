      I have a pretty modest computer setup. I use a 2014 13" Retina MacBook Pro hooked up
      to an external Dell monitor. I've avoided upgrading to the recent versions, because I
      don't want a TouchBar or a
      <a target="_blank" title="Clicking this link will open a YouTube video"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdS3tjEIqUA">bad keyboard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a big fan of the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro. Some say it's
      <a target="_blank" href="https://marco.org/2017/11/14/best-laptop-ever">the best laptop ever made</a>.
      It makes light work of most things I throw at it, and only ever really succumbs to
      the pressure of intense image processing, or running Xcode and Android Studio at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use an Apple Magic Keyboard which I <em>love</em>. It took a while to get used to the
      lack of travel, but now that I have, I couldn't imagine going back to a more mechanical
      keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm less happy about my mouse situation. I use an Apple Magic Mouse 2. It's not really
      great in any sense, but I've struggled to find a replacement I'm happy with. I've heard
      great things about the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-master-2s-flow">Logitech MX Master</a>
      but I'm yet to get my hands on one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some upcoming plans for improving my house office. One of those is to create a more
      permanent space for working. I'd also like a bigger monitor and a standing desk.

        This needs fleshing out a bit. I use Apple AirPods as my primary
        headphones, with a pair of Sennheiser Momentum's when I want to be
        absorbed into another dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stream Spotify to a Sonos Play:1 in my home office. I don't yet have
        any good speakers in my other rooms because I'm yet to convince myself
        I'm ready to go all-in on any particular brand.

    <p>
      I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> for vector
      work. I use it to quickly prototype website and app ideas, or to draw icons, and it's used
      at Loco2 to support our
      <a target="_blank" href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic design process</a>.
      I also have a secret passion for illustration and Sketch provides the perfect playground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/">Affinity Photo</a>
      is my go-to for photo editing and simple image adjustments.
      I previously subscribed to the Adobe Photography plan (Lightroom + Photoshop)
      but it's a bit overkill for the little editing I do. Not to mention that
      Affinity Photo is great and I'm very happy to support alternatives to the
      Adobe suite.
    </p>
    <p>I use iCloud Photo Library for syncing images across my devices.</p>

    <p class='subheading'>Code editing</p>
    <p>
      Some time in mid 2017 I decided to give
      <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>
      a shot. As a long time
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
      user, I was skeptical about anything replacing arguably the most important
      item in my toolbox. However, VSCode impressed me from the start. With its
      hightly customisable UI and vast array of easily-adjustable packages, it
      fit in quite well with my workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't abandoned Vim altogether though. It's still better at lots of
      things. I treat VSCode like a fully-integrated project-based IDE and use
      Vim for everything else.

    <p class='subheading'>Writing</p>
    <p>
      I use Apple notes for most of my note taking. Almost everything I write starts here,
      and may eventually move into a fully-formed word document in Google Docs,
      Microsoft Word or Apple Pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Google Docs at Loco2, and I've actually grown to enjoy collaborating
      in word documents and spreadsheets. It's just a shame Google Drive is so awful.

    <p class='subheading'>Email</p>
    <p>
      Since Google acquired and destroyed the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow_(email_client)">best macOS email client ever</a>,
      I've not found a suitable replacement. Instead, I stick to the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastmail.com">FastMail</a>
      and Gmail web clients. I use the Apple and Google mail apps on my mobile devices.

        I use

        for all passwords, <a href="https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/">two-factor authentication</a>,
        secure notes and identification documents. I'm a big fan of their

    <p class='subheading'>Web Browsing</p>
    <p>
      Safari on my MacBook and iPhone because it's fast and conveniently syncs

    <p>
      I still use Google Chrome when I'm doing frontend development because
      the devtools are second to none. I've tried to move to Firefox a
      few times, but it never really clicked.

  <h3 id='backups'>Backups</h3>
  <p>
    I wrote a bit about <a href="/posts/2019/backup-strategy">My Backup Strategy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 Backup Strategy</a>
    with Time Machine and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://bombich.com">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>
    hooked up to independant hard drives; a 500 GB WD My Passport that follows
    my laptop everywhere, and a 4TB WD My Book that sits at home and backs up over
    my home network.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a>
    is used for offsite backups. Google Photos provides another backup of my photo library.
    It's also really nice for sharing albums &ndash; iCloud Photo is <em>really</em> not good at this.

      <p>
        My Podcast list changes frequently, with new additions monthly
        and one or two occasional removals. There's a very strong tech focus
        amongst this list, and shamefully many of them just decant the same Apple news
        over and over. There's some diamonds in the rough, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I listen to all of these on the
