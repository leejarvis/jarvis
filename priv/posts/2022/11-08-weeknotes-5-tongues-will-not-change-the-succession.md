I'm now on Mastodon: [lee@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/web/@lee). I picked a Ruby server because that's where most of my Twitter following are going. It's taking some getting used to and given how little I actually use Twitter I'm not sure I'll be particularly active, but I wanted to see what it was all about.

I really wish I could disable boosts for all new followers by default.

The Elixir Phoenix dev team [released version 1.7-rc](https://phoenixframework.org/blog/phoenix-1.7-released) this week. I've been playing with 1.7 for a while now and I'm incredibly excited to be able to start building apps against a stable version in the coming weeks.

Component-driven frameworks seem to be the future (and the present, I suppose), and this version really leans on that. And, importantly, it does so in a way that doesn't force me to write---or even really care about---JavaScript.

Switched back to [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) after giving Apple Reminders a go for a few months. Turns out Apple is really just not great at software at the moment.

I replaced Tweetbot with [Spring for Twitter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spring-for-twitter/id1508706541) and it's better in almost every measurable way.

Purchased an Air Fryer ([Ninja MAX AF160UK](https://ninjakitchen.co.uk/product/ninja-air-fryer-max-af160uk-zidAF160UK)) and despite every review on YouTube suggesting it's only good for cooking chips and fried chicken, it has been a fantastic addition to our kitchen.

I started re-reading [The First Law series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Law). As I've found with many excellent books and TV shows (The Wire, The Sopranos), sometimes you have to have a couple of goes at it before you really _get it_. The first book in the series, The Blade Itself, had a similar start.

I also read Richard Osman's [The Thursday Murder Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thursday_Murder_Club). I usually prefer my murder mysteries a little less light-hearted, but I thoroughly enjoyed this read.

If you have book recommendations (Fantasy, Thrillery, Mysteryy or otherwise), I would love to hear them.

I finished a handful of TV shows recently. House of the Dragon was probably the highlight. In particular, the incredible performances by Paddy Considine (King Viserys) and Emma Dâ€™Arcy (Princess Rhaenyra). I've also been loving [The Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series))---though it is incredibly stressful to watch.

I started Andor and so far it is superb. I had to stop watching it when I realised it was good enough to require my full attention and plan on restarting this week.

Took a break from Destiny and played the new Call of Duty. Started the campaign on the hardest difficulty and now I'm stuck on the infamous [Alone](https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-mw2/Alone) mission. It's fun, though I'm not sure I'll be going anywhere near PvP.

DST ended a week ago and I'm not really over how dark it is. Like, all the time.
