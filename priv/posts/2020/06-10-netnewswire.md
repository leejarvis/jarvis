  summary: "Finally a sensible RSS Reader."

I've been using [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) as my primary news and RSS Reader for the past few months.

I haven't been truly happy with an RSS Reader since Google shut down Reader. And I've tried them all.

That is until I heard NetNewsWire was back in town. The original app was released almost 17 years ago now, and after exchanging hands a few times since then, it's now back home with its original creator Brent Simmons.

The new application is [blazingly fast](https://inessential.com/2020/05/18/why_netnewswire_is_fast) and very simple. It doesn't try to do anything fancy or over-complicatedâ€”an increasingly rare feature of modern software. It's also [Open Source](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire)!

The hybrid application supports iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Here's how it looks on my Mac:

There are a couple of missing features you might expect from a modern RSS Reader. It doesn't have any first-party sync support (Feedbin works, but I don't use it). Right now I'm exporting my subscriptions to iCloud and then importing them in on my phone.

I'd also like to see support for the ability to create smart-feeds with custom criteria for filtering articles. They have a very solid base though and the app is improving constantly.

I've recently been finding it difficult to avoid sinking time into social media (where I often go for news and interesting articles), and it seems increasingly difficult to know who and what to trust. NetNewsWire provides a nice way for me to filter out the noise and make sure I see content from creators I care about. I highly recommend it.
