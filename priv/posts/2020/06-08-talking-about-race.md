These past few weeks have seen police brutality erupt across the U.S. in response to the [murder of George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd) by Minneapolis Police Officers, and the ongoing [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com) movement.

America might be in the spotlight, but make no mistake; systemic racism exists all across the globe and we in the U.K. are no less guilty of it.

I've taken this as an opportunity to listen and learn. My first stop is the book [So You Want to Talk About Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099718-so-you-want-to-talk-about-race) by [Ijeoma Oluo](http://www.ijeomaoluo.com) which I'm half way through so far (I recommend it).

Here's a few other books I've seen recommended by others:

* [White Fragility: Why Itâ€™s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43708708-white-fragility) by [Robin DiAngelo](https://robindiangelo.com)
* [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow) by [Michelle Alexander](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3051490.Michelle_Alexander)
* [Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33606119-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race) by [Reni Eddo-Lodge](http://renieddolodge.co.uk)

I hope we can get better at Talking About Race. Because Black Lives Matter.
