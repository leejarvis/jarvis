[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets that can be solved in any programming language.

Each year since 2015, Advent of Code has created 25 small programming challenges for the days leading up to Christmas. Each challenge has two parts, the second of which is unlocked after completing the first. The challenges increase in difficulty as Christmas Day closes in and the final puzzle is posted on Christmas morning, in case you fancy foregoing breakfast with the family in a race to the leaderboard.

Advent of Code is great for people who want to:

1. Learn a new programming language
2. Learn new skills
3. Sharpen existing skills
4. Challenge themselves (and others)

All previous Advent of Code events are available on their website, so you can jump into more than 100 interesting puzzles of varying difficulty:

Oh and in case you wonder what it takes to achieve the leaderboard, check out [Jonathan Paulson's speed solving of the 2018 event challenges on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgv6d6rrQxo&list=PLZhotmgEsCQM_p8bqiGtvBJayKOxcmSWi) ü§Ø

If you enjoy the puzzles and have the means to, I urge you to [contribute](https://adventofcode.com/2019/support) in the ongoing building and running of Advent of Code. I can't imagine the work that goes into building these creative puzzles, and I'm really excited for the 2019 event.
