Woah it's September!

The last month has flown by, and unsurprisingly I haven't kept the blog
up-to-date. I have some good excuses though.

### I became a Dad üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß

My wife and I welcomed our daughter into the world. Lily Grace Jarvis
was born on 17 August at 14:00 and weighing a healthy 8lbs 5oz.

They're both doing wonderfully. And whilst the last few weeks have
been a bit of a blur, it's also been filled with some of our happiest moments.
I've also learned some things about [Fatherhood](/posts/2019/fatherhood).

### I got older ü•≥

I celebrated my 31st birthday on August 7. No it doesn't feel any
different, stop asking that.

### I read a bunch more ü§ì

This one might seem a little at odds with the whole having a baby thing,
but at the end of July I overcame my aversion for consuming digital books
and picked up some new titles to read on my iPhone.

After struggling through the first couple of days, I am now fully onboard
with reading books on a handheld device. I have increased my reading rate
by about 300% which is pretty crazy. I'm currently reading (or have
recently completed):

* [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck)
* [Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens?from_search=true)
* [Paradox by Catherine Coulter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37751667-paradox?from_search=true)
* [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep?from_search=true)
* [Triptych by Karin Slaughter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21717.Triptych?ac=1&from_search=true)

I really wish that I'd forced myself to do this sooner.

### I got a new camera üì∑

I love photography, but I've never thought myself any good. It's also
a fairly expensive hobby (if you let it be, which I absolutely could see
myself doing).

I wanted to challenge myself to become better so I decided to bite
the bullet and pick up a mirrorless camera. I went with mirrorless
because DSLR's are just too chunky for me and I think I'd seldom use it.

After some toing and froing, I picked up a
[Sony a6000](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit).
Whilst it's a
fairly old camera (which Sony finally upgraded 1 week after I purchased),
the reviews are _really_ good. Also:

1. It was on sale for almost 50% off
2. The Sony e-mount system really appeals to me. I can purchase better
   lenses and avoid upgrading the body until/if I outgrow it
3. The Sony firmware seems pretty good. This might not be a deal-breaker
   for most people, but it was important for me
4. It's _really_ popular. There's loads of YouTube videos and articles
   about this camera, and that appeals to me especially as someone new
   to mirrorless and APS-C sensors

### Next up ‚û°Ô∏è

That's it for now. I have a _very_ busy September ahead, and hope to
add a couple of new (more interesting) posts later this month.
