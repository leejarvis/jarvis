Today is my last day at [Loco2](https://loco2.com).

The last 6+ years have been wild. I've met some very talented people along the way
and have made plenty of friends.

I'm incredibly thankful for my time at Loco2. The culture and working environment is
like nothing I'd witnessed before, and something I will truly miss. I've learned a
lot and I'm very proud of what we've achieved (and, importantly, how we achieved it).

There's a bunch of reasons I made this decision, and I'll talk about the interesting
ones in upcoming blog posts. For now though, I will look back on my time at Loco2
fondly, and look forward to having some flexibility to spend time with my family.

So long and thanks for all the trains.
