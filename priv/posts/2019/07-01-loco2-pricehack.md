After years of hard work, UK split tickets are now available on
[Loco2](https://loco2.com/en/blog/pricehack-split-train-tickets).
This monumental project has been on our roadmap for many years, and I'm delighted to
finally bring it to train travellers across the country.

### What's split ticketing?

Split ticketing allows customers to save money on their train journey by purchasing two
or more tickets instead of one.

**For example**, imagine leaving Swansea at 07:30, bound for Perth. You're
travelling during peak time so you know your ticket will come at a premium.
It's £228.30. This is a nine hour journey, and only 1.5 hours of it take
place during peak time. That hardly seems fair.

Well, we can actually split this journey into _six_ tickets:

* Swansea - Crewe: £22
* Crewe - Manchester: £9.60
* Manchester - Preston: £10.30
* Preston - Lancaster: £5.90
* Lancaster - Edinburgh: £29.80
* Edinburgh - Perth: £8.90

For a total of £86.50 + £1.50 commission That's an incredible saving
of **£140.30**.

_Example from Swansea to Perth at 07:42 on 29 July 2019. Prices may change
closer to travel._

### What's Pricehack?

Pricehack provides a way for Loco2 to bring split ticketing to the masses. Imagine for a
moment that you're not a train geek (I know, a tough ask).
How would you know that you could save money by breaking up your journey?
And even if you did, which stations would you select?

That Swansea to Perth journey has 29 stops, do you have the time or patience
to search for every combination? I know I don't. With Pricehack, you don't have to
worry about the details. We'll do all of that complicated work for you, without you
having to ask.

Pricehack works across classes, too. You won't have to look hard to find a
cheaper first-class ticket than the price you'd usually pay for standard class.
Treat yourself, you deserve it.

Pricehack is the combination of cutting-edge software and intuitive customer experience.

### Aside: Mobile tickets

In 2017, a football fan
[booked a staggering 56-ticket split journey](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-38827931); saving
a total of £56. I can't imagine the pain he would have gone through to do this manually,
and having to juggle a handful of tickets makes the upfront work even less palatable.

Seasoned travellers might scoff at the notion of printing all of these tickets. And frankly,
I wouldn't blame them; the UK has lagged severely behind in adopting mobile technology for
our rail travel. Thankfully we're finally starting to catch up with the rest of Europe
in our endeavor to support fully mobile tickets.

Whilst not all train-operating companies grant mobile tickets just yet, those
that do will be available to you on Loco2 right now. With the Loco2 mobile
app, your mobile Pricehack tickets are a mere swipe away. All 56 of them.

### What about the rest of Europe?

Pricehack works by taking advantage of a very complicated UK rail fare system.
Whilst some of these complications do exist in other countries, none are so
glaringly apparent as to warrant complex technology like Pricehack.

We're always on the look-out for chances to apply our technology to new problems
though, and we're actively looking at ways we can extend this software to
make travellers lives easier.

In the meantime, Loco2 remains the best place to book your train journeys
across the UK and Europe in a single booking. No fuss, no fees, and a supportive
team of train geeks guiding your way.

As a software developer, projects like Pricehack don't come along often.
A truly complex and wonderful piece of technology that produces an unequivocal
benefit to many thousands of people.

It's been a long hard road (track?), but I'm incredibly proud of what the team
has built and I'm really looking forward to seeing how this technology
evolves.

Happy (price) hacking!
